# Welcome to the Deep and Shallow notebooks 

You can find notebooks to accompany each chapter in this repository.
The notebooks are intended to be interactive exercises to introduce the reader to ideas discussed in the book.
Each notebook may also function as a course homework assignment; questions are marked so that instructors can quickly identify places where students are asked to think, write, and code in response to a prompt.

Please reach out via GitHub "Issues" or email to the authors if there is anything we can do to assist you. 
Contributions towards updating notebooks to address changes to library versioning, or extensions to existing notebooks, are also welcomed.
